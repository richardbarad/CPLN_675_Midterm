# Planning Motivation

In June 2013 the city of Calgary experienced an extreme flooding events that resulted in the displacement of 100,000 people and 1.7 billion dollars were needed for repairs. The event was one of the costliest disaster in Canada's history. In this project we aim to build a predictive model that will help Calgary and cities with similar topography be better prepared for future large scale flooding events such as the 2013 disaster. 

The results of the model can help with early action and planning, as decision makers and public will have readily available information on what areas of the city might need to be evacuated. Additionally, the model can also help identify areas of the city that might need buyouts and/or revisions to the building code to require flood proofing. 

An advantage of our algorithm compared to FEMA federal level floodplain mapping is that the model should be able to help identify areas of flooding beyond just river flooding. Because the model is based on a historical event that resulted in flooding not near rivers, the model should be able to capture flooding in other low lying areas and valleys outside of riverine areas. Our model will be trained and tested using inundation data from the historical flood event in 2013. We will then use our model to predict flood risk in Denver. Denver was selected because the city of Denver has similar geographic characteristics to Calgary and contains multiple rivers. 

## Model Predictors

The predictors of flooding that we will use in our model are:

* Elevation above minimum elevation in the city
* Dominant Land Cover
* Slope
* Distance to Water
* Water Flow Accumulation (i.e: the number of grid squares flowing into a grid square)

Our analysis will use 100m x 100m grid and we use a logistic regression model to determine areas that are likely to be flooded during a flood event that is similar to the event that occurred in Calgary in 2013.

# Data Setup for Calgary

## Read Data for Calgary

Read the Calgary boundary and inundation layer.

```{r read_files, echo=FALSE}

calgary_boundary <- st_read('Data/calgary/CALGIS_CITYBOUND_LIMIT/CALGIS_CITYBOUND_LIMIT.shp') %>% st_transform('EPSG:3780')

inundation <- rast('Data/calgary/inundation/w001001.adf')

```

## Make Grid

Make a fishnet using st_make_grid and remove grid squares that are not located within the Calgary boundary.

```{r}

inundation <- project(inundation,'EPSG:3780') #Project innundation raster into correct cordinate system

grid <- st_make_grid(calgary_boundary,100,square=TRUE) %>%
  st_sf() %>%
  mutate(ID = row_number())

# Get just grid squares with centroid in Calgary city limits

grid <- grid %>%
  st_centroid() %>%
  st_join(.,calgary_boundary,join = st_intersects,left=FALSE) %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  left_join(.,grid,by='ID') %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  mutate(ID = row_number()) %>%
  select(ID)

```

Summarize the provided innundation data by grid square. Grid squares that are more than 25% innundated will be considered innundated in this model. 

```{r}

# Count the number of innundation cells in each grid square in fishnet

extract_values <- extract(inundation, grid) %>% #Assign each raster pixel to a grid square
  group_by(ID,w001001) %>% tally() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols=ID,names_from=w001001,values_from=n) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>% #Replace NA with 0
  filter(`NA` == 0) %>% #Filter out grid squares that do not have innundation data
  # 1 and 2 are innundation, sum thoose together and sum 0 and 3 together for non_inundation
  mutate(innundation = `1` + `2`,
         non_innundate = `0` + `3` + `NA`,
         in_id = as.factor(ifelse(innundation/(innundation + non_innundate) > 0.25,1,0))) %>% #If grid square is more than 25% innundate consider it innunduate (i.e: 1)
  select(ID,in_id)

```

The map below shows the inundation area summarized by grid squares. The inundated areas have a value of 1.

```{r}

grid2 <- right_join(grid,extract_values,by='ID') 

# Make Map of inundated areas

ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=grid2,aes(fill=in_id),color='transparent')+
  theme_void()

```

# Engineer Predictor Features for Calgary

## Elevation

Get zonal statistics for grid squares, calculate mean elevation for each.

```{r}

dem <- rast('Data/calgary/calgarydem/w001001.adf')

dem <- project(dem,'EPSG:3780')

elevation_extract <- terra::extract(dem,grid2,fun='mean',na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  rename(elevation_mean = w001001) %>%
  mutate(elevation = elevation_mean - min(elevation_mean))

grid3 <- cbind(grid2,elevation_extract %>% select(elevation))

```

## Land Cover

Summarize land cover data by grid square and figure out the mode land cover class for each grid square.

```{r}
#Need four land cover tiles to cover all of Calgary
land_cover1 <- rast('Data/calgary/worldcover/ESA_WorldCover_10m_2020_v100_N48W114_Map.tif')
land_cover2 <- rast('Data/calgary/worldcover/ESA_WorldCover_10m_2020_v100_N48W117_Map.tif')
land_cover3 <- rast('Data/calgary/worldcover/ESA_WorldCover_10m_2020_v100_N51W114_Map.tif')
land_cover4 <- rast('Data/calgary/worldcover/ESA_WorldCover_10m_2020_v100_N51W117_Map.tif')

calgary_land_cover <- terra::merge(land_cover1,land_cover2,land_cover3,land_cover4) #Merge together all land cover rasters that overlap Calgary

calgary_land_cover2 <- crop(calgary_land_cover, calgary_boundary %>% st_transform('EPSG:4326')) #Crop Raster to Calgary

grid4 <- grid3 %>% st_transform('EPSG:4326') #Project grid into WGS1984 so that I do not have to project the raster

mode <- function(class){
  which.max(tabulate(class))
}

# Extract raster values within each polygon and determine the most common raster value
land_cover_values <- extract(calgary_land_cover2, grid4) %>%
  rename(landcover = ESA_WorldCover_10m_2020_v100_N48W114_Map) %>%
  group_by(ID) %>% summarise(landcover_mode = mode(landcover)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(landcover_mode)

grid5 <- cbind(grid4,land_cover_values) %>% 
  st_transform('EPSG:3780') %>%
  mutate(landcover_mode = as.factor(landcover_mode))

```

## Distance to Water

Calculate distance from grid square centroid to water.

```{r}

water <- st_read('Data/calgary/Hydrology_20240320.geojson') %>% st_transform('EPSG:3780')

centroid <- grid5 %>%
  st_centroid()

nearest_feat <- st_nearest_feature(centroid,water)

grid5$water_dist <- as.double(st_distance(centroid, water[nearest_feat,], by_element=TRUE))

```


## Slope

Calculate slope and summarize slope by grid square - use max slope in each grid square.

```{r cal_slope}

calgary_slope <- terrain(dem, v="slope", neighbors=8, unit="degrees")  

slope_extract <- terra::extract(calgary_slope,grid5, fun='max', na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  rename(slope_max = slope) 

grid6 <- cbind(grid5,slope_extract %>% select(slope_max))

```

## Flow Accumilation

Summarize flow accumulation by grid square - use max flow accumulation for each grid square. Flow accumulation was calculated using ArcGIS Pro.

```{r cal_fa}

calgary_fa <- rast('Data/calgary/calgary_flowaccumilation.tif') 

calgary_fa <- project(calgary_fa,'EPSG:3780')

fa_extract <- terra::extract(calgary_fa,grid6, fun='max', na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  rename(fa_max = calgary_flowaccumilation) 

grid7 <- cbind(grid6,fa_extract %>% select(fa_max))

grid7$fa_log <- log(grid7$fa_max + 1)

```


# Make Maps of Predictors

The maps below show four of our predictors summarized by grid square. The four predictors are elevation (meters), distance to water (meters), Slope (degrees), and flow accumulation. For flow accumulation we took the natural log of th grid square values in order to account for the large left skew in the data. As shown, areas with a low elevation tend to be located near water. Additionally, areas near water tend to have a low slope and high flow accumilation.

``` {r make_maps,fig.width=14,fig.height=10}

create_map <- function(variable,title,color_scale,legend_label){
  ggplot()+
    geom_sf(data=grid7,aes(fill={{variable}}),color='transparent')+
    scale_fill_viridis(option=color_scale,name=legend_label)+
    ggtitle(title)+
    theme_void()
}

m1 <- create_map(elevation,'Elevation Above Minimum City Elevation (meters)','rocket','elevation (meters')

m2 <- create_map(water_dist,'Distance to Water (meters)','plasma','distance (meters)')

m3 <- create_map(slope_max,'Slope','magma','Slope')

m4 <- create_map(fa_log,'Flow Accumilation (Natural Log)','cividis','Number of Pixels')

grid.arrange(m1,m2,m3,m4)

```
